LSEG Interview Task

Notes during process:
1. Renamed logs.log file to input.txt, so that gitignore does not affect it.
2. Exporting methods to be visible for TypeDoc

Introduction

This document is going to explain why I should get this position and that I am an amazing developer... just a joke :)
However, I will try to provide as much guidance as I can for the evalutation process.

Setup
1. After you pulled from the repository, you need to build the project.
For this, you need to open project root in cmd or any type of terminal and type "npm run build".
Obviously, you need Node installed for that :)

2. Once build is complete, please, make sure "dist/files/input.txt" file contains all the input data that was provided in the email.

Note!: Documentation on each method, class and interface is available under "docs" folder.

3. Now you can run project locally with "npm start"

4. You can run all tests with "npm test" or "npm run test:coverage" for that sweet 100% test coverage!
